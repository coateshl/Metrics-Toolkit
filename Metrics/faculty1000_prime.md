| Name | Faculty of 1000 Prime: FFa, Ratings, Reviews
| Can Apply To | Articles published in a list of 3500 journals on biology and medicine
| Metric Definition | Ratings for selected articles are provided by F1000 Faculty. Reviews are commissioned and peer-reviewed before publication in F1000 Research. The FFa score is used to rank articles in each discipline.
| Metric Calculation | When Faculty Members recommend articles, they rate them as ‘Good’, ‘Very Good’ or ‘Exceptional’ (1, 2 or 3 stars, respectively). F1000 Article Factor (FFa) is based on all reviewers’ scores. Reviews are written and submitted when the article is scored. The review comments typically highlight key findings and put them into context. FFa is calculated based on the highest score assigned by reviewers plus an incremental value added for each additional rating. “F1000Prime ranks articles based on the total number of stars awarded to each recommended article. The more recommendations an article receives and the greater the total number of stars it receives, the higher its ranking will be.”
| Data Sources | F1000 Prime
| Appropriate Use Cases | F1000 metrics can be used an indicator of research quality. [FFa scores may be a better indicator for use in clinical practice than citations.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-013-0993-9)
| Limitations | The scope of F1000 is limited to a small fraction of the biology and medical literature. As of March, 2017, there were 100,000 articles in F1000, with approximately 1,500 added each month. Thus far, the [correlation between Faculty of 1000 recommendations and citations is clear but weak](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23040/full).
| Inappropriate Use Cases | The FFa should not be used as a direct measure of research impact.
